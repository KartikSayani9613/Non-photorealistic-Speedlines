# Non-photorealistic-Speedlines
We present an experimental algorithm to summarize motion of multiple objects in a short video into a single image. This depiction of this motion path is done with the help of speedlines. This reduces the amount of data, as compared to storing an image that conveys the same information as a video.By tracking the edges of the moving objects in the frames,we attempt to draw the motion lines at their rear edges. With the help of some techniques mentioned in existing literature, we detect the rear edges across multiple frames and record their paths. With these coordinates speed-lines are built as a straight-line or curved path. We also look at the applications for such a method and also provide results of our experiments along with some ideas for future applications.
